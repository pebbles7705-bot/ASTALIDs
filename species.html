        <div class="px-4">
          <h2>ASTALID OVERVIEW</h2>
          <p>ASTALID (As-tA-Lids) are a bipedal alien species from the planet OC-03. They're known for their segmented bodies, which are covered in a tough exoskeleton, their three eyes, their glass-like horns, and their hinged jaws. ASTALIDs comes in all shapes, sizes, colors, and personalities!</p>
          <p>They have five different sub-species within the ASTALID species:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>MAMMALIAN: The most common sub-species, known for their fur, exterior ears, tails, and animal feet.</li>
            <li>REPTILIAN: A sleek sub-species, with hard scales, sharp claws, a long tongue, heat pits on the face, and a powerful tail.</li>
            <li>AVIAN: The feathered sub-species, characterized by their two sets of wings, taloned feet, hollow bones, twin air sacs underneath their lungs, and feathered flesh.</li>
            <li>AQUATIC: A water-faring sub-species, adapted to life in aquatic environments with soft scales, gills, nubbed feet, three sets of bodily fins, and strong tail with fins.</li>
            <li>INSECTOID: The smallest sub-species, known for their full-body exoskeleton, multifaceted eyes, mandibles, antenna, pointed feet, and membranous wings.</li>
          </ul>

Each subspecies - Mammalian, Reptilian, Avian, Aquatic, and Insectoid - is depicted with their distinct physical features and no trait interference.">
          <p>ASTALIDs are a highly adaptable species, able to thrive in a variety of environments. They are also known for their strong sense of community and their ability to work together to overcome challenges.</p>

          <h2>ASTALID ANATOMY</h2>
          <p>Despite coming from a shared ancestry, each ASTALID is different, with unique traits and characteristics that set them apart from one another. Because of their shared ancestry, most have the same internal anatomy.</p>

              <p>This diagram illustrates the internal anatomy of an ASTALID, highlighting the internal skeleton. ASTALIDs, because of their exoskeleton, do not have  traditional rib cages, lower jaw bones, or a sternum. Instead, their internal structure is supported by a series of flexible cartilage and muscle groups. Their 'ribs' are fused with their exoskeleton and spine and do not show with any of the internal exposing traits.</p>

            <h4>ASTALID REPRODUCTION</h4>
              <p>ASTALIDs are hermaphroditic, meaning they possess both "male" and "female" reproductive organs. They can reproduce sexually or asexually, depending on environmental conditions and individual preference.</p>

          <h4>THE EFFECTS OF THE MOSISOP INFECTION</h4>
          <a data-toggle="collapse" class="btn btn-primary" href="#Tab4">CW:// Infection | Illness | Medical Biology</a>
          <div id="Tab4" class="collapse show"> <div class="p-2">
          <p>The Mosisop infection became a significant aspect of ASTALID biology and culture after it's awakening. It is a parasitic organism that infects ASTALIDs, leading to various physical and behavioral changes. The infection has been seen breaking down and destroying an ASTALID's body for the sole purpose of it's own survival and spread. Those infected with Mosisop often exhibit broken/cracked exoskeltons, decay of the flesh, darkening of the colors, Mosisop growth around key areas like the eyes/mouth/cracks in the exoskeleton/and the horns. The infection presents itself as moss-like growths with small white flowers and swirling roots that over take the body very quickly. Not many ASTALIDs survive the infection but their chance of recovery is greatly increased if the infection if caught before it spreads to the lungs and heart (Between stages 1 and 2).</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Stage 1: [Moss Bloom] The first stage of the Mosisop Infection is the hardest for most ASTALIDs. The parasitic spores are inhaled and grow exponentially in the lungs and airways. This causes intense pain and quickly targets an ASTALID's second heart. Most don't survive this process.</li>
            <li>Stage 2: [Roots Take Hold] Once the host is deceased, the Mosisop takes root and resumes motor functions. This is when an ASTALID's colors start to fade and their psychic ablities go haywire. If an ASTALID has managed to to survive through the first and second stage, the moss starts to attack the immune and nervous system. It will not stop until the host has passed and it can take over their mind.</li>
            <li>Stage 3: [Flower Bloom] The last stage of the infection. At this point, the Mosisop has fully taken over the host's body and mind, using it as a vessel to spread its spores and infect others. It does this with ruthless efficiency. In it's pursuit of spreading it's spores, the parasite no longer spends resources on maintaining the host's body and it begind to decay. Small white flowers will begin to bloom and release infection spores. They linger in the air like thick, glowing pollen and can survive for up to two weeks without a host.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Many ASTALIDs have grown in fear of the Mosisop infection and are taught early on about its dangers and how to recognize the symptoms. Education and awareness are key components in preventing the spread of the infection within their communities.</p>
          <h6>INFECTION SYMPTOMS</h6>
          <ul>
            <li>Eye color Discoloration/li>
            <li>Persistent cough and difficulty breathing</li>
            <li>Discoloration of the exoskeleton (darkening or fading)</li>
            <li>Cracks or breaks in the exoskeleton</li>
            <li>Moss-like growths on the skin, especially around the eyes, mouth, and cracks in the exoskeleton</li>
            <li>Behavioral changes, such as confusion, aggression, or lethargy</li>
            <li>Loss of psychic abilities or erratic psychic behavior</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>ASTALID SOCIETY AND CULTURE</h2>
          <p>ASTALID society is built around individuality and personal growth. They value creativity and self-expression, often showcasing their unique traits through art, music, and storytelling. Cultural traditions are passed down through generations, with a strong emphasis on community involvement and support.</p>
          <p>While there are some outlier ASTALIDs, many still follow the older, more traditional customs and practices from their homeworld social structures.</p>
          <h4>ASTALID SOCIAL STRUCTURE</h4>
          <p>Before the abrupt loss of their planet, ASTALID society was organized into various familiy clusters, each with its own customs and traditions. Leadership was often based on merit and the ability to contribute to the community, rather than strict hierarchies. While individuality was encouraged, there was also a strong sense of collective responsibility. Every member of the family, whether they were truely blood-related or not, played a part for the greater good of the family. It wasn't until the Mosisop infection splintered this dynamic did true personal growth and individuality emerge. Many families adapted to the new circumstances, finding ways to support each other and rebuild their identities, while some left the old ways behind and focused on self-discovery.</p>
          <h2>THE SOCIETAL TIMELINE</h2>
          <p>As mentioned earlier, the societal structure of ASTALIDs has evolved significantly over time. Key events, like the loss of their home world and the rise of the Mosisop infection, in their history have shaped their culture and social dynamics.</p>
          <p>As a basis, any ASTALID older than 85 years was born on OC-03 and went through the loss of their planet. The Mosisop Infection took hold of the planet in a matter of weeks so many didn't have time to react properly. Any ASTALID younger than 85 has possible been born on the Starship, or Earth, or on the wreckage of OC-03.</p>
          <H4>PSYCHIC ABILITIES AND THEIR SOCIAL CONTEXT</H4>
          <p>Psychic Abilities is a very common thing within ASTALID society. Each ASTALID has a special ability that they are born with. Each one is treated with respect from others because no matter how small, it is seen as a valuable contribution to the community.</p>
          <p>These abilities can range from telepathy and telekinesis to more unique powers like empathy or elemental manipulation. The diversity of abilities is celebrated, and many ASTALIDs find ways to incorporate their powers into their day-to-day lives.</p>
          <p>Many ASTALIDs find ways to incorporate their abilities into their jobs, their self-expression, and their interactions with others. This has led to a rich tapestry of psychic expression within ASTALID culture, with each individual's abilities contributing to the overall diversity and vibrancy of their community.</p>
          <H4>ASTALID SOCIETY AFTER EARTH</H4>
          <p>After the loss of their planet and their introduction to Earth, many ASTALIDs adapted to using Earth customs. Due to their unigendered society, many didn't know how to navigate the gendered norms of Earth culture. This caused some confusion initially, but over time, they found ways to blend their own customs with those of Earth. Some ASTALIDs took to using pronouns while some don't. It's all a matter of personal preference.</p>
          <p>Today, ASTALIDs continue to explore their identities and relationships within the context of Earth culture, often finding innovative ways to express their uniqueness while also embracing the diversity of their new home.</p>
          <hr class="mb-4" style="margin-top: 5px; border-top: 2px solid #ccc;">
          <h4>ASTALIDS TODAY</h4>
          <p>Due to the constantly shifting dynamics of their society, ASTALIDs today are a blend of their rich cultural heritage and the new influences from Earth. They continue to adapt and evolve, finding ways to express their unique identities while also integrating into their new environment. Some choose to live on Earth, some live on the Starship, and some unlucky few were left behind on OC-03. No matter where they are, ASTALIDs adapt and grow with their environment. As species and individuals, they strive to find their place in a universe that is constantly changing.</p>
