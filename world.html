          <h2>WORLD OVERVIEW</h2>
          <p>The world of ASTALIDs is a rich and diverse place, filled with unique landscapes, cultures, and histories. From the lush ruins of OC-03 to the steel walls of the Starship to the bustling cities of Earth, the ASTALID experience is shaped by their environments and the challenges they face.</p>
          <hr class="mb-4" style="margin-top: 5px; border-top: 2px solid #ccc;">
          <h2>THE RISE OF ASTALIDS</h2>
          <p>ASTALIDs, as a species and society, is relatively young in the grand scheme of the universe. 2 million years ago, a meteor impact on their home planet OC-03 triggered a series of events that would lead to their evolution into the spacefaring civilization they are today.</p>
          <p>ASTALID evolved incredibly quickly compared to similar species, developing advanced technology and a complex society in a relatively short period of time. One ASTALID, one of the first to evolve a high sentience, was BENNER. With his unparalleled intellect and innovative spirit, he became a key figure in the early days of ASTALID society. He synthesized a chemical serum simply known as 'Benner's Serum' that could drastically alter the genetic structure of an ASTALID, enhancing their physical and mental capabilities. He became a household name and a symbol of ASTALID ingenuity.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately, the rapid evolution of the ASTALIDs also led to unforeseen consequences. As they pushed the boundaries of their capabilities, they inadvertently triggered a dormant species hidden within their planet. This species, simply known as 'Mosisop', had originally been on the same meteor that started the evolution of ASTALID but remained dormant. Due to the rapidly expanding ASTALID population and their technological advancements, the Mosisop were awakened and began to pose a threat to the ASTALIDs. BENNER's partner, LIRA, was pregnant with their first child when she was infected. This led to BENNER mixing different forms of his serum to try and combat the infection but ultimately failed.</p>
          <h2>THE FALL OF OC-03</h2>
          <p>In a matter of weeks, the planet was completely overrun with the infection, leading to widespread chaos and destruction. Those who could, fled to the stars in search of a new home. Starship MEM-0R1, originally intended as a recreational cruise ship for the stars, turned into the last bastion of hope for the species. The remaining ASTALIDs fled to the ship and took to the stars.</p>
          <h2>STARSHIP M3M-0R1</h2>
          <p>The Starship M3M-0R1, a large interstellar vessel, was designed for long-duration space travel. It features advanced life support systems, hydroponic gardens, and a diverse crew of ASTALIDs from various backgrounds. The ship serves as a mobile home for the ASTALIDs as they search for a new planet to call home.</p>
          <p>It took a little while for ASTALIDs to settle in but their normal routines gradually adapted to life aboard the starship. They established communal living spaces, created recreational areas, and developed a new culture that blended the diverse backgrounds from the remaining families. Captain Hilde was appointed as the leader of the ship, guiding the ASTALIDs through the challenges of space travel and ensuring their survival. A military like force was made to protect the ship and its inhabitants, known as the "Starship Forces".</p>
          <hr class="mb-4" style="margin-top: 5px; border-top: 2px solid #ccc;">
          <h2>ASTALIDS ON EARTH</h2>
          <p>After years of searching, the Starship M3M-0R1 finally discovered a suitable planet: Earth. The ASTALIDs made contact with Earth's governments and negotiated a peaceful settlement. They established multiple colonies on Earth, integrating into human society while maintaining their unique culture and traditions and adapting to Earth's environment.</p>
