        <div class="px-4">
          <p>Before humans were even a thought, meteors filled space with the building blocks of life. Over eons, these celestial travelers coalesced into planets, giving birth to diverse ecosystems and, eventually, intelligent beings. One such planet was OC-03. From the meteor, ASTALIDs evolved. They were small and fragile at first, often being at the bottom of the food chain, until they developed physic abilities that helped them survive. With their newfound powers, higher intelligence came. Soon they left their primitive lifestyle behind and began to explore their world. ASTALID society blossomed spectacularly, leading to the development of advanced technologies and a rich culture.</p>
          <p>One ASTALID, a renowned scientist named Dr. Benner, made a groundbreaking discovery; the ability to manipulate the very foundation of ASTALID biology. This revelation led to the creation of various ASTALID subspecies, each with unique traits and abilities. As ASTALIDs continued to evolve and adapt, they became a dominant force in the galaxy, known for their intellect, creativity, and resilience. But, with their newfound fame came challenges. The very abilities that set them apart also attracted the attention of those who sought to exploit their powers for their own gain.</p>
          <p>One such entity was 'The Mosisop', a hive-mind moss like parasitic organism that sought to control ASTALIDs and harness their abilities for its own purposes. It came to OC-03 and quickly infected the planet's ecosystem, spreading its spores and taking control of the native ASTALIDs. The once-thriving civilization found itself under siege from within, as friends and family became unwitting hosts to the Mosisop's will. The infected soon began to lose their individuality, becoming mere extensions of the Mosisop's collective consciousness. The infection spread like wildfire, and soon, the majority of ASTALIDs were under the Mosisop's control.</p>
          <p>In response to this existential threat, a group of talented ASTALIDs created a way out, <b>The Starship MEM-0R1</b>; a space-faring vessel designed to escape the clutches of the Mosisop and seek a new home among the stars.</p>
          <p>Now, without a planet, ASTALIDs roam the stars in search for a new home and a cure.</p>
